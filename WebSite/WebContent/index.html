		<h1>FlexyMouse</h1>

		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>FlexyMouse let you use your phone (or tablet) as a wireless 3D controller.</p>
		<p>The main idea is to use the sensor devices (such as the accelerometer or gyroscope) which are present on all descent
			smartphones to detect rotation in 3D space.</p>
		<p>Widgets such as buttons, sliders or even trackpads could add extra controls but the key feature is to detect 3D
			rotation movements (ie. well kown as yaw, pitch, roll in aeronautics field).</p>
		<p>The main use case is to use FlexyMouse as a controller in flight simulations (specially for helicopters simulation
			where all the 3 rotation axes need to be perfectly controlled) but at the end it could be used in other simulations or even in any
			games or software.</p>
		<p>FlexyMouse will communicate with PC via Bluetooth, that way no special software will need to be installed on the target
			PC.</p>

				    <h2>Android application</h2>
					<h3>Requirements</h3>
					<p>A smartphone or tablet with Android version 4.3 (API Level 18).</p>
					<h3>Download</h3>
					<p>
						The application is not (yet) on the Google Play store so you have to download the following <a
							href="FlexyMouseAndroid.apk">APK file</a> and install it manually on your Android device.
					</p>
					<p>
						By default your Android device doesn't allow you to install APK files from unknown sources. To get rid of that you have to
						go to the Security section in Android settings and activate the <i>Unknown sources</i> checkbox
					</p>
					<h3>Known issues</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>The GUI let you to choose various sensor mode but currently only the default one (ORIENTATION_V1) is really
							functional.</li>
						<li>The GUI let you activate Bluetooth but only Wifi (or even 3G/4G) connections to a listener are functional for now. That's
							why so you really should install FlexyMouseListener, see below.</li>
						<li>When you try connect to a listener the connection seems to be always successful even if no listener is listening [ALMOST FIXED]</li>
					</ul>

		<h2>iOS application</h2>

		<p>Hmm not available (yet), sorry..</p>

		<h2>Java listener</h2>
		<p>That component is optional, It's small application developed in Java for testing purpose. It listens events from a
			FlexyMouse device and rotate various 3D models.</p>
		<p>
			<a href="FlexyMouseListener.jnlp">Launch FlexyMouseListener with Java Web Start.</a>
		</p>
		<img src="screenshots/FlexyMouseListener.png" alt="Listener screenshot" style="text-align: right;" />
		<h3>Requirements</h3>
		<p>A PC with an installation of Java (6 or more)</p>
		<h3>Known issues</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Security issue : </b>Since the application is self-signed it should be blocked by your system so you have to
				change your Java security settings. On Windows you have to go to Configuration Panel, click on the Java icon and then on the
				Security tab and change the security level to <i>Medium</i>. But since that level has been removed on latest Java release
				(there's only <i>High</i> or <i>Very high</i> in Java 8, no more <i>Medium</i>), you may have to add an exception for the
				website <i>www.onlacherien.org</i> in order to be able to launch the application</li>
			<li><b>Bug in Java 7 : </b>There's a known bug in Java 7 (between update 25 and update 65) on Windows with AWT and Java Web Start.
				So if it's your case you should upgrade to the latest release of Java 7, or use Java 8.</li>
